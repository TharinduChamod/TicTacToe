## About

● Display a 3x3 matrix of buttons.

● Each player gets a turn to pick a button which is not selected. If the player
selects a button that is already selected, the system ignore that selection
and let the user select again until he/she picks a free button.

● The buttons selected by user 1 should be marked with a 1 with red color and that for user 2 is
2 with blue color.

● User 1 gets the first chance, then user 2 gets the chance and so on.

● Based on the pick, the game continues (in which case the other player
should get his/her turn) or end with either a win to the current player or a draw.
When the game ends the results displayed in a different window with exit and restart option.
